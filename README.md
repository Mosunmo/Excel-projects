# Excel-projects
The Excel project involved a number of advanced functions, including VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, Pivot Tables, and a Loan Analytics Dashboard.

The VLOOKUP function was used to lookup values in a table and return corresponding values from another column. INDEX MATCH was used as an alternative to VLOOKUP, allowing for more flexibility in searching for values in a table.

Pivot Tables were used to summarize and analyze large data sets, allowing for easy filtering, sorting, and grouping of data. The Loan Analytics Dashboard provided an overview of loan data, including loan amounts, interest rates, and payment schedules, allowing for easy tracking of loan performance.

Overall, the Excel project demonstrated a high level of proficiency in using advanced Excel functions to analyze and manage complex data sets. The use of Pivot Tables and the Loan Analytics Dashboard provided an efficient and effective means of visualizing and interpreting data, allowing for informed decision-making and improved business performance.
